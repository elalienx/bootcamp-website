// Note:
// This section has a weird layout, needing containers in each section because of 2 special design elements for mobile:
// 1. The about hero, a image that takes the 100% of the screen but only appears on mobile.
// 2. The projects scrolling from left to right.
#about
  .introduction,
  .technologies,
    overflow: auto // so these parents respect their children margins

    .container
      margin-bottom: 0

  .technologies
    .component-items
      margin-bottom: 0 // so the margin top of the next section dictates the space between sections
