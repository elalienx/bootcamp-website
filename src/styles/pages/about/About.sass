// This section has a weird layout, needing containers in each section because of 2 special design elements for mobile:
// 1. The about hero, a image that takes the 100% of the screen but only appears on mobile.
// 2. The projects scrolling from left to right.

  // Technologies happens to be in between the 2 sections with weird layouts,
  // thus, instead of manually add code to each section to controll the space,
  // technologies can take care of both.
